# JRTree
RTree encoding/decoding library for JS.

<p>
In order to use this library, simply import RTree.js (the other files are there only for display on how this library is implemented.
You do not need to download or import any of them. RTree.js is all you need)
Then, you can access all of its functions which are:
<ul>
<li>
RTree.decode(source)
</li>
<li>
Rtree.basic_decode(source);
</li>
<li>
RTree.fully_encode(tree);
</li>
<li>
RTree.basic_encode(data);
</li>
</ul>
</p>
